# Challenge 6 - 5 Day Weather Forecast

## Description

This program was written in order to further one's understanding of server-side API calls.

By using the wonderful API's provided by open weather, I was able to convert a cities written name

into usable data to display a 5 day forecast.


## Installation

No additional steps required to install. Just navigate to page. It has been tested functional

on current versions of Google Chrome and Firefox as of April 16, 2023. See usage for notes on firefox systems

## Usage

When you first run site on firefox it may give you mixed content error. To get site working you need to click security options and temp disable that security. You don't need to do this for chrome.

Use the site however you like. As stated in the text input box, you can add a comma and country code

to a city in order to narrow it down more. Ex there is a difference between searching "Whitby" and "Whitby, CA"

## Credits

This project could have never been deployed without the help of the fantastic bootcamp instructors, Adam Nym and Daler Singh.

Understanding parts of code was achieved using OpenAI's ChatGPT
